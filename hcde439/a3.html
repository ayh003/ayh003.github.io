    <h1>Assignment 3 Input Output!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A3resub.gif" alt="A3 Assignment GIF" />
      <p>For this assignment, I created a circuit with two LEDs (red and green)
         controlled by a photoresistor. The photoresistor changes its resistance
         based on light intensity, and the value is read through the analog input
         pin (A0). When the environment is bright, both LEDs are off. As the light
         gets dimmer, the LEDs' brightness increases. When it's dark, the LEDs
         will be bright.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Calculations</h1>

    <h2>Schematic</h2>
    <img src="A3Resubschematic.jpg" alt="Schematic for A3 Assignment" />
    <p>In my schematic, the photoresistor (LDR) is placed in a voltage
       divider circuit with a fixed resistor. One side of the photoresistor
       is connected to the resistor, and the other side is connected to
       the analog input pin A0. The resistance of the
       photoresistor changes based on the intensity of light. 
       When it is bright, its resistance decreases, resulting in a lower
       voltage at the analog pin, while in darker conditions, its resistance
       increases, leading to a higher voltage. This voltage is read by the
       Arduino using analogRead(). The red and green LEDs are connected to PWM
       pins 9 and 10, each with a 220 ohm’s resistor to prevent
       excessive current flow. As the light dims and the resistance of the
       photoresistor increases, the Arduino increases the LED brightness 
       using analogWrite(), making the LEDs brighter when it's dark and 
       turning them off when the light is bright.</p>
    
    <h3>Circuit</h3>
    <img src="A3circuitresub.jpg" alt="Circuit Diagram" />
    <p>This is how I built my circuit. I started by placing
       the photoresistor (LDR) on the breadboard then connect
       one end of the photoresistor to the power supply on the
       breadboard, and the other end to a 10kΩ resistor. Also
       connecting the other end of the resistor to ground, with
      the other side of the photoresistor and resistor as the
      analog input pin (A0) on the Arduino, where the light 
      intensity will be read. For the LEDs, I added the red 
      and green LEDs into the breadboard, ensuring the anode
      connects to the pins 9 & 10 on the Arduino. Connected 
      the cathode of each LED to ground through a 220Ω resistor 
      to protect the LEDs from excess current. Lastly, powered 
      the Arduino using a USB connection to the laptop.</p>

    <h4>Code:</h4>
    <pre><code>

      const int redPin = 10;   // red LED to pin 10
      const int greenPin = 9;   // green LED to pin 9
      
      const int analogInPin = A0; // A0 is the input pin for the photoresistor
      
      int sensorValue = 0; // stores the sensor value from the photoresistor
      int ledBrightness = 0; // stores the brightness level for both LEDs
      
      void setup() {
        pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);  // Set the red LED pin as an output
        pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);  // Set the green LED pin as an output
        Serial.begin(9600);  // Start serial communication at 9600
      }
      
      void loop() {
        sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);  // Read sensor value from the photoresistor
      
        // Prints the sensor value to the Serial Monitor
        Serial.print("Sensor input: ");
        Serial.println(sensorValue);
      
      // If the sensor value is higher than 600 (bright)
        if (sensorValue > 600) { 
          analogWrite(redPin, 0);  // Turn off the red LED
          analogWrite(greenPin, 0);  // Turn off the green LED
          Serial.println("Lights OFF");  // Print a message to the Serial Monitor
      
        } else {  // If the sensor value is lower than 600 (dim)
          ledBrightness = map(sensorValue, 600, 100, 0, 255);  // Map sensor (0 to 255)
          ledBrightness = constrain(ledBrightness, 0, 255);  // brightness stays within 0-255 range
      
          analogWrite(redPin, ledBrightness);  // brightness of the red LED
          analogWrite(greenPin, ledBrightness);  // brightness of the green LED
      
          // LED brightness to the Serial Monitor 
          Serial.print("LED Brightness: ");
          Serial.println(ledBrightness);
        }
      
        Serial.println("");  // blank line 
        delay(150);  // Wait for 150 milliseconds
      }

    <h5>Questions</h5>
    <p>Question 1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 
      or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</p>
    <p>A1: 
      <img src="q1resub.jpg" />
      Technically, the resistor can be R1 or R2 depending on what you want the output(Vout) to be.
      If you want Vout to decrease as it gets darker, use R1. If you want Vout to increase as it gets darker, use R2. In my circuit, since the LED turns on when it gets darker, I should use 
      R2, as it makes it easier to trigger the LED brightness.
    </p>

    <p> Question 2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
    <p>A2:</p>

    </p>

    <p>Question 3:  AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</p>
    <p>A3: If I had a 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit ADC, their value ranges would be different: the 10-bit PWM would range from 0 to 1023, while the 16-bit ADC would range from 0 to 65535. 
      To map the ADC values to the PWM range, Id use the map() function to scale the ADC values from 0-65535 to the PWM range of 0-1023. It would look like: map(Value, 0, 65535, 0, 1023)</p>
