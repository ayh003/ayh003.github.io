    <h1>Assignment 5 High(er) voltage and transistors!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A5 motor.gif" />
      <p>For A5, we needed to use an N-MOSFET transistor, an external power supply, and an input sensor. In class, we used the H-bridge and the fan motor. 
        Therefore, I was thinking I could do something similar and use the N-MOSFET instead. I also read the extra resources for help.
        The input would be the remote. Going into this, I knew I might struggle with using the remote because, 
        in the last assignment, I couldn't get the remote to work. However, I didnt want to doubt myself, so I decided to give it a try anyway. 
        After hours of trying to figure it out, I realized I should have approached it differently.
        Everything works, but the components didn't work together as expected. The fan motor would spin and function when connected to the 
        external power supply. However, when I tried to control it with the remote, it wouldnt work. I know the remote was functioning 
        because it was printing messages to the serial monitor. Overall, it worked, but not the way I expected it to. I also wasnt sure if 
        it was my code that was the issue or if its my wiring. But at this point, I didnt have more time to figure out the issue. My plan was so that I use
        IR receiver to receive signals from a remote that would allow you to turn on and off the dc motor. If you press 1, it will turn on and if you press 2, it 
        would turn off. I was also scared that I would short circuit, so I tried to be more careful. Attached is also of a gif of the remote working. </p>

<h5>Questions</h5>
<p> Question 1: What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3? </p>
<p>A1: The highest current the transistor can handle before it risks damage. Continuous Drain Current, and Pulsed Drain Current. It is labelled as 80A.   </p>
<p>Question3:Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.</p>

<pre><code>
// Define motor control pins
pin = 1
pin = 2
pin = 7
pin = 10
pin = 13

// Move both motors forward
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH)
digitalWrite(pin, LOW)
delay
//Move backwards
digitalWrite(pin, LOW)
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH)
delay
