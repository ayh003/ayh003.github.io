    <h1>Final Project Proposal!</h1>

      <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I want to build a motion-activated LED strip that lights up when 
        I walk down the stairs at night. The LEDs will follow step by step 
        as I move up or down. If this approach doesn’t work as intended, 
        I will have the LED strip be activated by another method and slowly 
        fade out. Additionally, I will integrate an LCD screen to display messages. 
        My motivation for this project comes from my own experience—whenever I 
        go downstairs at night, I always have to turn the lights on and off 
        manually. With this system, the stairway lighting will be more efficient, 
        automated, and convenient.

    <h3>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>LED strip</li>
      <li>Motion Sensor (ultrasonic sonar sensor HC-SR04)</li>
      <li>Arduino</li>
      <li>Battery pack (for wireless use)</li>
      <li>MOSFET</li>
      <li>Soldering wires to the LED strip</li>
      <li>Wires & Resistors</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Timeline and Contingency Plans</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Week 1:</strong> I will test individual components to ensure they function correctly. This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Testing the LED strips (checking brightness and functionality), adjusting them to my preferences.</li>
        <li>Testing the motion sensor (detection range and response time).</li>
        <li>Testing the LCD screen (ensuring it works and displays messages correctly).</li>
        <li>Working on the code to ensure the LEDs turn on when motion is detected, and replacing any components that don’t work.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Week 2:</strong> I will create something to hide the breadboard and wires while still allowing the motion sensor to detect movement. I will also:
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the wires and battery are correctly placed and functioning.</li>
        <li>Improve the LED transition effects and debug any coding issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If something goes wrong with this plan, such as the LED strips not working, I will check the wiring for issues or replace the LED strip if necessary. My biggest concern is the motion sensor, as I have not worked with it before. If the sensor doesn’t work as expected, I will check its placement and adjust its sensitivity. If issues continue, I might try using a different type of sensor.
