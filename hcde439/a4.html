    <h1>Assignment 4 Libraries!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="a4libraries.gif" />
      <p>For this project, I built a circuit that uses a remote control and joystick as inputs, and a servo motor as the output. The system lets the user control the servo motor both wirelessly (with the remote) and manually (with the joystick). I used the Servo and IRremote libraries to make it work. However, due to time limits, I couldn't figure out the problem with my code for the remote. When I press the "1" and "2" buttons on the remote, the servo motor doesn't respond. I think there might be an issue with the signal, as the remote and servo motor arent communicating as expected. Even though the remote part isn't working, the joystick functions as its intended.</p>

    <p> Here is the schematic for my libraries. I made majority of my connections on the arduino board. </p>

<p> Additional Questions</p>
<p>Q1: Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</p>
<img src="a4q1.jpg" />
<p>Q2:Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</p>
<p>A2: Can address this by taking multiple readings.</p>
<p>// take multiple readings </p>
<p>// take the readings and find the sum</p>
<p>// Calculate the average of the reading</p>
<p>Q3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this?</p>
<p>A3: Take the mulitple measurements, and take the average</p>
<p>// take multiple readings</p>
<p>// calculate the average</p>
