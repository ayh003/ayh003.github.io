    <h1>Assignment 6 Talking to the Web!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="A6 talking to the web.gif" />
      <p>For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a webpage using p5.js that interacts with an Arduino. The project also required incorporating keyboard or mouse interactions to trigger physical changes. Additionally, the webpage needed to be interactive.
        For my homework, I used a joystick (which counts as 2-3 inputs), a button (another input), and three LEDs (outputs). This idea was inspired by the rectangle example from the class example. The joystick controls the movement of rectangles on the webpage, while pressing the button changes the background color. The LEDs can be turned on and off using keyboard numbers 1-6.
        The GIF demonstrates how all these components interact and function together.  </p>

    <h2>Calculations:</h2>
    <img src="A6 Calculations.jpg" alt="Resistor Calculations" />
    <p> Here are the calculations for the yellow, green, and red resistors!
        After performing the calculations, I decided that a 220-ohm resistor is safe to use.
        For the button, I used a 10k-ohm resistor as a pull-down resistor. This helps control the flow of electricity, ensuring 
        stable input readings and preventing unintended behavior. It also ensures that the circuit remains complete and functional 
        without sudden disconnections or floating signals.

    <h3>Schematic:</h3>
    <img src="A6 Schematic.jpg" />
    <p>The schematic consists of a joystick, a button, three LEDs, and an Arduino, are all interconnected to enable two-way interaction 
        between arduino and the p5.js webpage. The joystick, which functions as both an analog and digital input, has two potentiometers 
        that control the X and Y axes, sending analog values to A1 and A0 on the Arduino. Additionally, it has a built-in button connected 
        to digital pin 2 as a digital input. A push button is connected to digital pin 3, with a 10k-ohm pull-down resistor ensuring stable 
        input readings by keeping the signal LOW when not pressed. The three LEDs act as outputs, connected to digital pins 8, 9, and 10, each
         with a 220-ohm resistor to limit current and prevent damage. The Arduino continuously reads the joysticks X and Y values along with 
         the button states and transmits them using Serial communication to the p5.js webpage. The webpage processes the joystick input to 
         move rectangles on the screen and changes the background color when the button is pressed. Additionally, the webpage can send 
         commands back to the Arduino using keypresses 1-6 to control the LEDs, turning them on or off based on user input. Power 
         comes from the Arduinos 5V pin, while all parts share a common ground to complete the circuit.
    </p>

    <h4>Circuit:</h4>
    <img src="A6 Circuit.jpg" />
    <p>The circuit was built by connecting each component to the Arduino while ensuring proper voltage, grounding, and signal flow. 
        The joystick has five pins: VCC, GND, VRX, VRY, and SW. The VCC was connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino, and GND was connected 
        to the Arduinos GND. The VRX and VRY pins were connected to A1 and A0. The joystick button (SW) is connected to digital pin 2, 
        with the internal pull-up resistor enabled in the code to make sure a stable signal when its not pressed. The push button was 
        wired separately using a 10k-ohm pull-down resistor to ensure signal when its not pressed. One leg of the button was connected 
        to power, while the opposite leg was connected to digital pin 3 and also to GND through the pull-down resistor. This ensures 
        that when the button is pressed, it sends a high signal to the Arduino. For the three LEDs, each was connected to a separate 
        PWM digital pin (8, 9, and 10). Each LEDs anode was connected to its own pin, while the cathode was connected to GND through 
        a 220-ohm resistor. These resistors prevent excessive current flow, protecting both the LEDs and the Arduino.</p>
